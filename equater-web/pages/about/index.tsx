                    Let's face it, it sounds great to ask your friend to split the Netflix bill with you, but do you
                    really want to have nag that person every month for the $5 they owe you?
                </p>
                <p className={'text-secondary text-base md:text-xl text-left m-0 mt-4'}>
                    Rent costs a lot though. Surely, you'll make it a priority every month to get several hundred or
                    even thousands of dollars you're owed, right?
                </p>
                <p className={'text-secondary text-base md:text-xl text-left m-0 mt-4'}>
                    The real question you should be asking is, "Why should I have to do this in the first place??".

                    What you want is an agreement - an agreement that's honored automatically by technology. A push
                    notification sounds a whole lot better than a menial recurring task, right?

                    With Equater, that's exactly what you get. It takes 2 minutes to sign up and split your first
                    expense, so what are you waiting for?
